Cloning this repository from the Hostmonster account:

git clone -u /home1/mattdpar/git/bin/git-upload-pack mattdpar@mattdparker.com:/home1/mattdpar/git/cosmic.git

We need to explicitly tell git where the git-upload-pack binary is because
remote connections don't load .bashrc on Hostmonster. It will fail saying it
can't find the binary otherwise. After cloning you can git push and git pull to
your heart's content.

After that you'll probably want to do this:

git remote add origin ssh://mattdpar@mattdparker.com/home1/mattdpar/git/cosmic.git
