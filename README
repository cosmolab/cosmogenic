Cosmogenic
=================================================

Cosmogenic is a python library for calculations involving cosmogenic nuclides.

Modules
-------

muon:          production from muons
production:    production rate functions
scaling:       functions for scaling
sim:           geomorphic and exposure models
util:          utility functions
datareduction: functions for reducing AMS data (work in progress)

Installation
------------

To work properly, Cosmogenic expects that you have already installed a recent
version of the SciPy stack. See here for your options:
http://www.scipy.org/install.html

Advanced Installation
---------------------

Installing using pip on Linux (Debian 7):

We must first install several dependencies:

sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran libfreetype6-dev libpng-dev

This may be necessary, but might be overkill:

sudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib

Otherwise, If you want interactive plotting you will want to install at least
onebackend for matplotlib as well. Tk is well supported:

sudo apt-get install tk tk-dev
pip install numpy
pip install -r pip-requirements

cd /path/to/cosmogenic/code

pip install .

Once we are listed on PyPI it should be possible to use:

pip install cosmogenic

But we're not quite there yet.
