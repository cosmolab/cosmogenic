Neighborhood Algorithm Input/Output/Data persistence
----------------------------------------------------

The NA module needs to be usable on arbitary data, independent of the package.
Not only for CN measurement data.

Designing with that in mind, the user should be responsible for loading the
data that is relevant for their problem and using it as input to their
objective function.
The simplest use case is that they do this in a script.
Documentation should advise them to save their input data in a file in the 
same directory as the script and where the output file will be produced.

Results file structure:
/
/search01
/search01/metadata:
	stores the settings used for the search
/search01/search_ensemble:
	stores the search results
	models (2d array)
	fitness (1d array corresponding to models)
	result (optional, the model result that gave the fit, 1 or 2d array)
/search01/resample01
/search01/resample01/metadata:
	settings for the resampling
/search01/resample01/ensemble:
	models (2d array)
	stats (sim to dict)
	plots (various named image files)

These data sets aren't that terribly huge, might be simplest to not use a
binary format.
Then the user could interactively browse in their favorite file browser, go
look at the plots.
All makes sense due to the hierarchy we create.
Then it is just a matter of standardizing the format for individual files.
Don't use pickle.
